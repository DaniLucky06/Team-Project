                    <p id="first-paragraph">
                        According to the <a href="https://food.ec.europa.eu/plants/pesticides_en" target="_blank">European Commission</a> a 'pesticide' is "something that <b>prevents</b>, <b>destroys</b>, or <b>controls</b> a harmful organism ('pest') or disease, or protects plants or plant products during production, storage and transport."
                        <br>
                        The term includes, amongst others: herbicides, fungicides, insecticides, acaricides, nematicides, molluscicides, growth regulators, repellents, rodenticides and biocides.
                        <br><br>
                        But pesticide use causes several problems to the environment and humans. Pesticides are used in public health to kill vectors of disease, such as mosquitoes, and in agriculture to kill pests that damage crops. People are exposed to low levels of pesticides through food and water and are generally not a cause for concern. The people at greatest risk of adverse health effects are those who work directly with pesticides, such as agricultural workers.

                        The <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7908628/" target="_blank">history</a> of pesticide use can be divided into three time periods:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Before 1870, pests were controlled using various natural compounds. The first documented use of pesticides was around 4500 years ago by the Sumerians.</li>
                        <li>Between 1870 and 1945, the adoption of synthetic materials of an inorganic nature emerged. Toward the end of the 19th century, Swedes employed compounds containing copper and sulphur to protect fruit and potatoes from fungal attacks.</li>
                        <li>The third era commenced post-1945, marked by the introduction of synthetic pesticides following the discovery of the effects of chemicals such as Dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT), Î²-Hexachlorocyclohexane (BHC), aldrin, dieldrin, endrin, chlordane, parathion, captan, and 2,4-D.</li>

Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.</p>
